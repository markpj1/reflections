got log git diff

using logical commits can be a saver of time and frustration,
try to do commits that are not to small so you can avoid to many files,
  not to large that you cannot see the diff. maybe think in modular

git checkout a8ljlkjdljoijljsdj;al
git diff 7798hljl jljlj
git log returns last five commits scroll for more
q Q for quit
right clicks for copy and paste

version control allows you to check old code and compare changes with highlight
